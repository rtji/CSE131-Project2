STRATEGY / CODING APPROACH

Our strategy is as follows: 

1. Using the GLSL PDF, we outlined the structure of the rules, terminals and
non-terminals. 

2. We filled all the vertical returns, which are identified by { $$ = $1; }.

3. We incrementally implemented the rules of the grammar to pass the
elementary, given tests: test1, test2, test3. 

4. We implemented the more difficult grammar to pass the harder test cases. 

5. We debugged our bugs. 

6. Upon debugging our bugs, we found new bugs. Go back to step 5. If no new
bugs were found, we gave each other high fives and cried tears of joy.
